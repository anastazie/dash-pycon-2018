# Dash for beautiful and easy data visualization

We will work with [example Dash app](https://github.com/anastazie/dash-pycon-2018/blob/master/example_project.py) 
that we will improve.

In our example we have data about books, data comes from 
[the bookshelf of J. H. Maindonald](http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/courses/math47/R/library/DAAG/html/allbacks.html), 
who, apparently, like to read.

What do you like to do in your free time: read bake or may be play with toy cars? 
Wouldnt it be interesting to know more about these activities? (*Spoiler*: yes, it would be interesting)

Then go ahead and add one more item to our dropdown menu named `Play with cars` with value name `cars`.
